#pragma mark Class Methods

// Uses the really basic settings to build a URL from the string.
/*"	Fix a URL-encoded string that may have some characters that makes NSURL barf.
 It basically re-encodes the string, but ignores escape characters + and %, and also #.
 Example bad characters:  smart quotes.  If you try to create NSURL URLWithString: and your string
 has smart quotes, the NSURL is nil!

#pragma mark Managing Behavior

// Default is NO. If YES, -stringForObjectValue: will return -[NSFileManager displayNameâ€¦] for file URLs
@property(nonatomic) BOOL useDisplayNameForFileURLs;

// If the URL's host does not have a top-level domain specified, and this is non-nil, it is substituted in. Defaults is "com"
